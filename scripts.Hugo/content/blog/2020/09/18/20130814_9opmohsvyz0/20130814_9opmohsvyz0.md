info2 : "Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION-- American history in VOA Special English. I m Steve Ember. This week in our series, Bob Doughty and I tell about American arts and popular culture during the 1930s. Hard economic times and social conflict have always offered a rich source of material for artists and writers. A painter s colors can show the drying of dreams or the flight of the human spirit. A musician can express the tensions and uncertainty of a people in struggle. The pressures of hard times can be the force to lift a writer s imagination to new heights. So it was during the 1930s in the United States. The severe economic crisis-- the Great Depression-- created an atmosphere for artistic imagination and creative expression. The common feeling of struggle also led 1,000,000s of Americans to look to films, radio and other new art forms for relief from their day-to-day cares.  The most popular sound of the 1930s was a new kind of music--  swing  music. And the  King of Swing  was a clarinet player named Benny Goodman. Benny Goodman and other musicians made swing music extremely popular during the 1930s. Swing music was a new form of jazz. Many of its 1st players were black musicians in small, unknown groups. It was only when more well-known white musicians started playing swing music in the middle 1930s that the new music became wildly popular. One reason for the popularity of swing music was the growing power of radio during the 1930s. Radio had already proven in earlier years that it could be an important force in both politics and popular culture. 1,000,000s of Americans bought radios during the 1920s. But radio grew up in the 1930s. Producers became more skillful in creating programs. And actors and actresses began to understand the special needs and power of this new electronic art form. Swing music was not the only kind of music that radio helped make popular. The 1930s also saw increasing popularity for traditional, classical music by Beethoven, Bach and other great musicians. In 1930, the Columbia Broadcasting System began a series of concerts by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra on Sunday afternoons. The next year, the National Broadcasting Company, NBC, began weekly opera concerts.  In 1937, NBC asked Arturo Toscanini of Italy to lead an orchestra on American radio. Toscanini was the greatest orchestra leader of his day. 1,000,000s of Americans listened at Christmas time as Toscanini and the NBC Orchestra began playing the 1st of 10 special radio concerts. It was a great moment for both music and radio. For the 1st time, 1,000,000s of average Americans were able to hear classical music by great musicians as it was being played.  Music was an important reason why 1,000,000s of Americans gathered to listen to the radio during the 1930s. But even more popular were a series of weekly programs with exciting or funny new actors. Families would come home from school or work and laugh at the foolish experiences of such actors as Jack Benny, Fred Allen, George Burns, Edgar Bergen, and WC Fields. Radio helped people forget the hard conditions of the Great Depression. And it helped to bring Americans together and share experiences. The success of radio and films, as well as the depression itself, caused problems for many Americans newspapers during the 1930s. The trouble was not so much that readers stopped buying newspapers. It was that companies talked about their products through advertisements on radio instead of buying advertising space in newspapers. Nearly half of the nation s independently published newspapers either stopped publishing or joined larger companies during the 1930s. By WWII, only 100 20 cities had competing newspapers.  Weekly and monthly publications faced the same problem as daily newspapers-- increased competition from radio and films. Many magazines failed. The 2 big successes of the period were Life Magazine and the Reader s Digest. Life Magazine had stories for everyone about film actors, news events, or just daily life in the home or on the farm. Its photographs were the greatest anywhere. Reader s Digest published shorter forms of stories from other magazines and sources. The tensions and troubles of the Great Depression provided a rich atmosphere for artists and others to produce works that were serious, foolish, or just plain fun. And those works, in turn, helped make life a little better as Americans waited, worked, and hoped for times to improve. "
