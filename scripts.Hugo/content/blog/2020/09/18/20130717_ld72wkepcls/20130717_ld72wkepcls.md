info2 : "Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. In September of 1901, President William McKinley was assassinated. His Vice President, Theodore Roosevelt, was sworn in to replace him. Roosevelt was 42-years-old-- the youngest man ever to hold the office of President of the United States. The man who came to represent the spirit of reform most of all was the new President, Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt was born to a wealthy family in New York City in 1858. He was a weak child with poor eyesight. He spent much of his time reading. When Theodore was 13-years-old, he got into an argument with two other boys. He tried to fight them. But he was not strong enough. That incident was a turning point in Roosevelt s life. He decided to overcome his physical weaknesses through exercise and hard work. He lifted weights, ran long distances, and learned how to be a boxer. He continued these activities while he attended Harvard University. After college, Roosevelt married Alice Lee and returned to New York. He became active in the Republican Party. When he was just 23-years-old, he was elected to the state legislature. Roosevelt quickly became known as a reform politician. He denounced all forms of dishonesty in government. Roosevelt s first political career did not last long. He withdrew after four years, following the deaths of his wife and mother. His sadness was so great that he could not continue. In 1897, President William McKinley named Theodore Roosevelt Assistant Secretary of the Navy. The United States went to war against Spain a year later. Roosevelt wanted an active part in the war. So, he resigned and joined the army. He organized a force of horse soldiers known as the  Rough Riders.  They were honored for bravery in the Battle of San Juan Hill in Cuba. Roosevelt was now a war hero. Republican Party leaders in New York thought he would be the perfect candidate for governor. Teddy, as the public called him, won a close election. He soon made clear he would not take orders from party leaders. The public praised Roosevelt s reform efforts. Local party leaders did not. As one    I do not want him raising hell in my state any longer.  Local leaders decided the best way to get him out of New York politics was to support him for Vice President of the United States. The office gave a man very little voice or power in politics. Roosevelt did not want the job, for that reason. By then he wanted just one   to be President of the United States. He was sure being vice President would ruin his chances. But he accepted the nomination at the national convention. He would run on the ticket with William McKinley. Sadly he    I do not expect to go any further in politics.  Several months after he was sworn-in as Vice President, he was sworn-in as President. William McKinley was dead. Theodore Roosevelt became President as the result of an assassin s bullet. Roosevelt promised party leaders that he would continue McKinley s policies. He said he would move slowly in making any changes. In his first message to Congress, President Roosevelt offered a few new proposals. He asked for a Department of Commerce and Labor to deal with industrial problems. He called for a stronger Navy and for limits on immigration. And he proposed building a canal in central America to link the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Businessmen who feared the worse when Roosevelt became President began to breathe easier. It seemed he was not going to push for reforms after all. But Roosevelt was only following an old hunting rule of African tribesmen.  Speak softly,  the rule said,  and carry a big stick.  Roosevelt spoke softly during his first months as President. He would use the big stick later. When the blow came, it was against big business. A group of wealthy railroad owners had agreed to join their railroads into one. They formed a company to control it. The new company would have complete control of railroad transportation in the American West. There would be no competition. President Roosevelt believed the company violated the Sherman Anti-Trust Law. The law said it was illegal for businesses to interfere with trade among the states. The law also said it was illegal for any person or group to get control of a whole industry. Since the anti-trust law had been passed in 1890, few companies had been found guilty of violating it. So, many people were shocked when Roosevelt announced he was taking action under the law against the railroad trust. He said there could be no compromise in how the law was enforced. That will be our story next week. "
