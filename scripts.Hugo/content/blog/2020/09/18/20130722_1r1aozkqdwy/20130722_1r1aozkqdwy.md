info2 : "Welcome to the MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. June 18th, 1910, was an exciting day for Theodore Roosevelt. It was the day that the former American president returned from a long trip to Africa and Europe. 100,000s of people gathered in New York City to welcome him home. There were speeches and bands and a parade. This week in our series, Frank Oliver and Tony Riggs tell us about Teddy Roosevelt s trip. They also tell us how political problems hurt his friendship with President William Howard Taft. In Germany, they met Kaiser Wilhelm II. Kaiser Wilhelm invited the former American President to watch a big parade of German troops. He told him:  You are the first civilian who has ever joined the Kaiser in reviewing the troops of Germany.  The two men were photographed shaking hands. On the back of the photograph, the Kaiser wrote:  When we shake hands, we shake the world.  The Roosevelts met the Kings and Queens of Norway, Belgium, and the Netherlands. They met the crown Princes of Sweden and Denmark. And, while in England, Mr. Roosevelt served as America s official representative at the funeral of King Edward VII. The split developed because progressives expected Taft to rule as Roosevelt had done -- with energy and emotion. They wanted a man who could excite people with dreams of social progress. Theodore Roosevelt was such a man. William Howard Taft was not. He was a big, slow-moving man. He refused to make quick decisions. As a former judge, he depended on facts, not emotion, to make decisions. President Taft did much to carry out the reform programs Theodore Roosevelt had begun. But his methods led people to believe that he was really trying to kill the programs. President Taft invited Theodore Roosevelt to visit him at the White House. Roosevelt said he could not. However, he did meet with many of the progressive opponents of the President. Later, he met with Taft at the President s summer home in Massachusetts. It was not a happy meeting. The two friends were tense. By this time, Roosevelt had decided that he agreed with the progressives. He believed President Taft had turned back many of Roosevelt s policies.    Theodore Roosevelt hoped his speaking trip would help Republican Party candidates win in the 1910 congressional elections. His efforts seemed to fail. Republicans were defeated in many states. For a year after the party s defeat in the congressional elections, Theodore Roosevelt remained silent. Then, near the end of 1911, America s political parties began to prepare for the Presidential election that would be held the following year. Roosevelt was sure Taft could not be re-elected. Taft had become very conservative. He had close ties to business interests. What the people wanted, thought Roosevelt, was a progressive President. What they wanted was a man like himself. So, Theodore Roosevelt began to speak out again in opposition to many of the things President Taft was doing. For example, President Taft had proposed treaties with Canada, Britain, and France. Roosevelt criticized them.  Taft was troubled. He told a friend:  It is very hard to take all these blows from Roosevelt. I do not know what he is trying to do, except to make my way more difficult. It is very hard to see a close friendship going to pieces like a rope of sand.  By now it was clear to Taft that Roosevelt wanted to be the Presidential candidate of the Republican Party in the election of 1912.  Taft believed he could win the Republican nomination for President. He still had the support of many party leaders.  Four months before the Republican nominating convention opened, several progressive Republican governors appealed to Roosevelt. They urged him to declare himself a candidate for president. Roosevelt, they said, was the man to lead the nation into a new era of social progress. Then Taft made a strong statement against the progressives.  They are seeking,  he said,  to pull down the temple of freedom and representative government.  A reporter asked Roosevelt to answer Taft s statement. Roosevelt said:  My hat is in the ring.  That meant he was a candidate. Now, the conflict was in the open. And Roosevelt was ready to fight.  In his speeches, Roosevelt criticized Taft bitterly. In a voice shaking with hatred, he said Taft was controlled by conservative politicians. He said Taft stood in the way of progress. He said Taft was disloyal. Taft had to answer. In one speech, he said:  This tears my soul. I am here to answer an old and true friend who has made many charges. I deny all those charges. I do not want to fight Theodore Roosevelt. But I am going to fight him.  After the speech, a reporter looked for the president. He found him sitting alone, his head in his hands. His eyes were filled with tears.  Roosevelt was my closest friend,  Taft said. "
