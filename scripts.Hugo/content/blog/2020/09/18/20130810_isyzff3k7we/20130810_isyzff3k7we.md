info2 : "Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION-- American History in VOA Special English. Hoover succeeded in some areas of his foreign policy. But he failed to solve America s economic troubles. And, like most Americans, he failed to recognize the importance of political changes taking place in Japan and Germany.   Herbert Hoover s foreign policy was marked by his desire to make friends and avoid war.   Hoover worked toward this goal even before he entered the White House.  Following his election, he had several months before becoming President. Hoover used this time to travel to Latin America for 10 weeks. He wanted to show Latin American nations that they could trust the United States to honor their rights as independent nations.  Hoover kept his word. The year after he took office, his administration announced that it would recognize the governments of all Latin American countries, including governments that the United States did not like.  Hoover told the American people that he would not follow the Latin American policies of President Theodore Roosevelt.      Hoover withdrew American forces from Nicaragua. He also arranged to withdraw them from Haiti. And he showed restraint as some 50 revolutions shook the nations of Latin America.  Some revolutionary governments opposed the United States. They refused to pay debts to American companies, or they claimed ownership of foreign property. But Hoover refused to advance American interests by force. He wanted to prove that the United States could treat Latin American nations as equals.  That policy was quite successful. Relations between the United States and Latin American countries generally improved under Herbert Hoover s leadership.   The situation in Europe was much more difficult and much more serious for the United States. The problem was simple-- money. The Great Depression did not stop at America s borders. It moved to Britain, Europe and beyond. And it brought extremely hard economic conditions.    The economic crisis also put great pressure on the international circle of debt that had been created after the war. Suddenly, American bankers could no longer make loans to Germany. This meant that Germany could not pay back war debts to France and the other Allied nations in  the war to end all wars.  And without this money, the Allied nations could not repay money that they owed American banks.  The circle of debt fell apart.  The situation grew worse and worse throughout the early months of 1930. Hoover finally had to announce that all nations could delay their debt payments to the United States for 1 year. Throughout Europe, people withdrew their money from banks. As a result, the European banks could not repay more than a !$1,000,000,000 that they had borrowed from private American banks.   The threat in Asia became clear first. As years passed, Japan began to feel threatened by two forces. 1st, Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek was trying to organize all of China under the control of his Nationalist forces. 2nd, Russia was extending the Chinese Eastern Railway to the Russian port city of Vladivostok.  Japan s army took control of the government in Tokyo in late 1931. The army was fearful of the growing threat to Japan s control of Manchuria. So it moved Japanese troops immediately into several Manchurian cities. And it claimed political control of the whole area.  President Hoover and most Americans strongly opposed Japan s aggression. But they were not willing to take any action that might lead to another world war.    Japan s military leaders knew that the people of Europe and America had no desire to fight to protect China. And so the Japanese army marched on. It invaded the huge city of Shanghai, killing 1000s of civilians.  Western leaders condemned the action. American Secretary of State Henry Stimson said the United States would not recognize Japanese control in these areas of China.  But, again, Hoover refused to consider any economic actions against the Japanese. And he strongly opposed taking any military action.  The League of Nations also refused to recognize Japan s takeover. It called Japan the aggressor in Manchuria. Japan reacted simply. It withdrew from the League of Nations.   Most Americans were not happy about Japan s aggression. But they were not willing to fight force with force. This was less true, however, for Secretary of State Stimson.     The same story was true in Europe. But France was worried about the rising power of the Nazis in Germany and the Fascists in Italy and Spain. France proposed the creation of an international army.  Hoover opposed that idea. He called for all nations to reduce their weapons. He believed that negotiation, not force, was the way to solve the problem.  But the new leaders in Germany and Japan would listen much more closely to the boot steps of marching troops than to the high words of peace. "
