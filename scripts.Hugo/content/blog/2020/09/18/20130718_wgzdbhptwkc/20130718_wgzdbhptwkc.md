info2 : "BOB   Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. In the early 1900s, a group of wealthy American businessmen agreed to join their railroads. They formed a company, or Trust, to control the joint railroad. The new company would have complete control of rail transportation in the American West. There would be no competition. President Roosevelt believed the new company violated the Sherman Anti-Trust Law. The law said it was illegal for businesses to interfere with trade among the states. Roosevelt said he would make no compromises in enforcing the law. He asked the Supreme Court to break up the Railroad Trust. The Supreme Court ruled against the Railroad Trust. In the next few years, other Trusts would be broken up in the same way. The American people called this Trust-busting. And they called Theodore Roosevelt the Trust-buster. Roosevelt made several speeches explaining his position on big business. Everywhere he went, he found wide public support. Later, he told a friend why people liked him so well. He    I put into words what is in their hearts and minds, but not in their mouths.  President Roosevelt won even more public support for his actions during a labor crisis in the coal industry. The incident was one of many in American history in which a president had to decide if he should interfere in private industry. Coal miners went on strike in the spring of 1902. They demanded more pay and safer working conditions. Mine owners refused to negotiate. One even insulted the miners. Finally, Roosevelt got both sides to agree to a compromise. Mine owners agreed to have an independent committee study the miners  demands. And the miners  agreed to return to work until the study was completed. Several months later, the report was ready. The committee proposed that miners accept a smaller pay increase in exchange for improved working conditions. Both sides accepted the proposal. The coal strike ended. Not everyone was happy. Many people still felt Roosevelt had no right to interfere. Roosevelt disagreed.  My business,  he said,  is to see fair play among all men -- capitalists or wage-workers. All I want to do is see that every man has a fair deal. No more, no less.  Roosevelt believed the United States needed a strong leader. He planned to strengthen the Presidency whenever he could. Roosevelt set aside large areas of forest land for national use. He created fifty special areas to protect wildlife. And he established a number of national parks. Theodore Roosevelt faced the responsibilities of foreign policy with the same strength he used in facing national problems. He firmly believed in expanding American power in the world.  We have no choice,  he said,  as to whether or not we will play a great part in the world. All that we can decide is whether we will play our part well or poorly.  To play well, Roosevelt said, the United States needed a strong Navy. It also needed a canal across Central America so the Navy could sail quickly between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. For many years, people had dreamed of such a waterway. With a canal across Central America, ships could sail directly from ocean to ocean. They would not have to make the long, costly voyage around the southern end of South America. The most likely place to build such a canal was at the thinnest point of   Panama. Another possible place was just to the   Nicaragua. Over the years, several attempts were made to build the canal. In the 1880s, Ferdinand de Lesseps -- builder of the Suez Canal -- formed a French company to build a waterway across Panama. De Lesseps spent $300,000,000 to build just one-third of the canal. He could get no more money. His company failed. In the 1890s, an American company tried to build a canal across Nicaragua. It made little progress. After 3 years, it gave up the attempt. When Theodore Roosevelt became president in the early 1900s, he was ready to try again. A study was made to decide which would be a better place for the canal -- Panama or Nicaragua. Engineers said it would cost less to complete the canal De Lesseps had started 20 years earlier in Panama. But De Lesseps  company still owned the land on which the canal would be built. The United States would have to buy the land, as well as the rights to build the waterway. The study decided it would be less costly, overall, to build the canal in Nicaragua. The proposal went to the United States Congress for approval. That will be our story next week. "
