info2 : "Eisenhower - D-Day radio broadcast   BBC - Battle of Britain broadcast Hitler could not strengthen his forces in North Africa and Italy, because Germany also was fighting hard in the Soviet Union. Hitler s decision early in the war to attack the Soviet Union was a serious mistake. It divided his men and materials. His plan was to defeat Soviet forces quickly with 1 strong attack. But he failed. And his failure cost him valuable troops and supplies that might have helped him win the battles for North Africa and Italy. Germany s attack on the Soviet Union began with great success. In the middle of 1941, a German force of more than 3 million men invaded the Soviet Union. It captured the Ukraine, took control of Kiev, and marched deep into Russia. The situation changed the following year. Soviet forces under Marshal Georgy Zhukov won a fierce battle for the city of Stalingrad-- now Volgograd. A great many German soldiers died from cold and hunger during the bitter winter months that followed.  Zhukov s forces attacked the German troops and pushed back the invaders. Other Soviet troops forced the Germans away from the city of Leningrad-- now St. Petersburg. By the middle of 1944, German forces throughout the Soviet Union were retreating. And Soviet forces were preparing to push them over the border and invade Germany themselves. The fighting came at a terrible cost. Huge numbers of soldiers and civilians were killed.  The most famous air battle of the war in Europe took place during the summer and autumn of the previous year. It was known as the Battle of Britain. It got its name from a speech to Parliament by Prime Minister Churchill following the evacuation of British and French forces from Dunkirk.  This is the BBC Home Service. Here is the news. In the House of Commons this afternoon, the prime minister, Mr. Churchill, said:  What General Weygand called the Battle of France is over. The Battle of Britain is about to begin.    It was the most extensive aerial bombing yet in the war.  It was also the 1st battle to be fought entirely in the air.  German Stuka dive-bombers attacked shipping centers, areas of political importance, airfields, and airplane factories.  Luftwaffe pilots in their Messerschmidts battled the Hurricanes and Spitfires of the Royal Air Force. While the flying skills of the German and British pilots were well matched, it was ultimately the greater maneuverability of the British Spitfire that won the long months of battle over the English Channel.  The British victory in the air helped prevent  Operation Sea Lion,  a planned German invasion of Britain. In May of 1942, Britain s Royal Air Force carried out an attack on Germany with 1 thousand bombers. It was just the 1st of many bombing runs over Germany and German-occupied areas by the air forces of Britain and the United States. The planes bombed German military and industrial centers. They also bombed civilian targets in an effort to demonstrate to the German people the price of Germany s aggression. The German cities of Cologne, Dresden and Hamburg suffered widespread destruction. The Allied bombing attacks continued until the war s end in 1945. Hitler s victories in the early months of the war had struck fear in the hearts of people throughout the world. Hitler and his Axis allies had won battle after battle. They had captured most of western Europe and invaded the Soviet Union. They had seized North Africa. And their submarines controlled the Atlantic.  Germany continued to seem strong during the 1st months after the United States entered the war in Europe. But the situation began to change. German strength and control were greatest in November of 1942. After then, the mighty German military machine began to slow down. Germany and its Axis partner Italy suffered serious losses in the 1st 6 months of 1943. German losses were extremely heavy in the Soviet Union. 160,000 and German troops died at Stalingrad, and more than 110,000 surrendered. American and British forces captured 250,000 German and Italian troops in North Africa. Many more 1000s were killed or captured in Sicily and the Italian mainland. German submarines were being destroyed in the North Atlantic, allowing more Allied troops and supplies to reach Britain. By the end of 1943, Hitler and his armies no longer seemed so strong. But German forces continued to occupy France, Belgium and much of the rest of western Europe. Now, the time had come for the Allies to invade German-held Europe from Britain. "
