info2 : "Chamberlain Speech  Peace in Our Time  - Roosevelt Speech live Another challenge to American neutrality came in Asia. Japan launched a new invasion of China in July, 1937. Within 1 month, Japanese forces gained control of what was then called Peking, now Beijing, and Tientsin. The United States had long supported the Nationalist forces of China. And many Americans were angry about the Japanese invasion. But Roosevelt and his administration once again refused to take strong actions against the aggression. And neither Roosevelt nor the Congress wanted to be 1st to break America s official policy of neutrality. Franklin Roosevelt made clear in private talks with friends that he understood the serious threat to world peace created by Adolf Hitler and other Fascists. He believed that the United States could not remain neutral forever if democracy was threatened in so many countries. Public opinion in the United States was strongly against any kind of involvement in foreign conflicts. In 1937, Roosevelt made an important speech calling for the world s neutral nations to protect themselves from lawless Fascist nations. But many Americans feared that Roosevelt was trying to create a new alliance. And they opposed his efforts. A public opinion survey at the time showed that less than 1 in 3 Americans was willing to change the nation s strong neutrality laws to give Roosevelt more freedom of action. Adolf Hitler s Nazi forces moved into the Rhineland in 1936. 2 years later, they invaded Austria. And then, in the following months, Hitler began making demands on the government of Czechoslovakia. Britain s Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was afraid that Hitler might start a general European war if he was blocked from gaining control of Czechoslovakia. In September of 1938, Chamberlain traveled to Munich to discuss the situation with the German leader. The result was that Britain agreed to a German takeover of Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain returned to London promising  peace in our time.   The settlement of the Czechoslovakian problem which has now been achieved is, in my view, only the prelude to a largersettlement in which all Europe may find peace. [Crowd cheers] This morning, I had another talk with the German chancellor, Herr Hitler, and here is the paper which bears his name upon it, as well as mine. [More cheers.] Some of you perhaps have already heard what it contains, but I would just like to read it to you. We, the German Führer and Chancellor and the British Prime Minister, have had a further meeting today, and are agreed in recognizing that the question of Anglo-German relations is of the 1st importance for the 2 countries, and for Europe. We regard the agreement signed last night, and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, as symbolic of the desire of our 2 peoples never to go to war with 1 another again.  The 1st reaction of most Americans to Chamberlain s Munich agreement was 1 of relief. But then, public opinion changed. Americans saw that Hitler s Germany now had control of central Europe. Japan was becoming more powerful in Asia. Chamberlain s weakness only served to show dictators that they could gain land and power through aggression and fear. Roosevelt warned Americans in late 1938 about this Fascist threat.  There can be no peace,  he said,  if another nation makes the threat of war its national policy.   There can be no peace if national policy adopts as a deliberate instrument the threat of war. There can be no peace if national policy adopts as a deliberate instrument the dispersion all over the world of 1,000,000s of helpless and persecuted wanderers with no place to lay their heads. There can be no peace if humble men and women are not free to think their own thoughts, to express their own feelings, and to worship God.  There can be no peace if economic resources that ought to be devoted to social and economic reconstruction are to be diverted to an intensified competition in armaments.  But events in early 1939 showed that war was on the way. Germany occupied Czechoslovakia and then Lithuania. Franco s forces took control in Spain. Italy invaded Albania. And then Hitler began making demands on Poland. In August, Germany and the Soviet Union announced to the world that they had signed a non-aggression agreement. A week later, Germany attacked Poland. 2 days later, Britain and France declared war on Germany. "
