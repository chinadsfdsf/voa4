info2 : "Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION-- American history in VOA Special English. Warren Harding won the election. By their votes, Americans made clear they were tired of sacrificing lives and money to solve other people s problems. They just wanted to live their own lives and make their own country a better place. This was a great change in the nation s thinking. For 20 years, since the beginning of the century, the United States had become more involved in international events. Young Americans had grown up with Presidents like Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt. Both Wilson and Roosevelt had active foreign policies. Both helped start the nation on the road to becoming a major world power. Wages for most workers in the United States were higher than ever at the beginning of the 1920s. Men and women had enough money to enjoy life more than they had in the past. Technology made it possible for 1,000,000s of people to improve their lives. It also caused great changes in American society. 2 of the most important new technologies were automobiles and radio. In the early years of the 20th century, automobiles were very costly. Each 1 was built separately by a small team of skilled workers. Most Americans did not have the money to own an automobile. Then Henry Ford decided to make cars everyone could buy. He built them on an assembly line. Cars were put together, or assembled, as they moved slowly through the factory. Each worker did just 1 thing to the car before it moved on to the next worker. In this way, the Ford Motor Company could build cars more quickly and easily. And it could sell them for much less money. Before long, there were cars everywhere. All these cars created a need for better roads.  Cars helped Americans learn more about their nation. In the 1920s, people could drive all across the land for not much money. Places that used to be days apart now seemed suddenly closer. Families that normally stayed home on weekends and holidays began to explore the country. They drove to the seashores and lakeshores. To the mountains and forests. To places of historical importance or natural beauty. Not all the changes linked to the car were good, of course. Automobile accidents became more common and deadly. Other forms of transportation, such as railroads, began to suffer from the competition. Some railroads had to close down. Horses and wagons-- once the most common form of transportation-- began to disappear from city streets. There were not enough cars in the 1920s to cause severe air pollution. But the air was becoming less pure every year. And the roads were becoming more crowded and noisy. While the automobile greatly changed America s transportation, radio greatly changed its communication. The 1st radio station opened in the state of Pennsylvania in 1920. Within 10 years, there were 100s of others. There were more than 13 million radio receivers. Most of the radio stations were owned by large broadcasting networks. These networks were able to broadcast the same program to stations all over the country. Most programs were simple and entertaining. There were radio plays, comedy shows, and music programs. But there also were news reports and political events. 1,000,000s of people who never read newspapers now heard the news on radio. Citizens everywhere could hear the President s voice. Like the automobile, radio helped bring Americans together. They were able to share many of the same events and experiences. Radio also was a great help to companies. Businesses could buy time on radio programs for advertisements. In these  ads , they told listeners about their products. They urged them to buy the   cars. Electric refrigerators. Foods. Medicines. In this way, companies quickly and easily created a nationwide demand for their goods. Automobiles and radios were not the only new technologies to change American life in the days after WWI. Still 1 more invention would have a great effect on how Americans spent their time and money. That was the motion picture. It will be our story next week. "
