info2 : "Please excuse the ads..price for including copyrighted music in video  Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION-- American history in VOA Special English. I m Barbara Klein.  And I m Steve Ember. The stock market crash of 1929 marked the beginning of the worst economic crisis in American history. 1,000,000s of people lost their jobs. 1000s lost their homes. During the next several years, a large part of the richest nation on earth learned what it meant to be poor. Workers lost their jobs as factories closed. Business owners lost their stores and sometimes their homes. Farmers lost their land as they struggled with falling prices and natural disasters. And Americans were not the only ones who suffered. This week in our series, we talk about the economic crisis that became the Great Depression. One of America s greatest writers, John Steinbeck, described the depression this way:  It was a terrible, troubled time. I can t think of any 10 years in history when so much happened in so many directions. Violent change took place. Our country was shaped, our lives changed, our government rebuilt.  Steinbeck, winner of the 1962 Nobel Prize in literature, said:  When the market fell, the factories, mines, and steelworks closed and then no one could buy anything, not even food.    Unemployment rose sharply. The number of workers looking for a job jumped from 3 percent to more than !25% in just 4 years. 1 of every 3 or 4 workers was looking for a job in 1932.   Falling production. Rising unemployment. Men begging in the streets. But there was more to the Great Depression. At that time, the federal government did not guarantee the money that people put in banks. When people could not repay loans, banks began to close. In 1929, 659 banks with total holdings of $250,000,000 went out of business. The next year, 2 times that number failed. And the year after that, almost twice that number of banks went out of business. 1,000,000s of persons lost all their savings. They had no money left. The depression caused serious public health problems. Hospitals across the country were filled with sick people whose main illness was a lack of food. The health department in New York City found that 1 of every 5 of the city s children did not get enough food. !99% of the children attending a school in a coal-mining area of the country reportedly were underweight. In some places, people died of hunger. The quality of housing also fell. Families were forced to crowd into small houses or apartments to share costs. Many people had no homes at all. They slept on public streets, buses or trains. One official in Chicago reported in 1931 that several hundred women without homes were sleeping in city parks. In a number of cities, people without homes built their houses from whatever materials they could find. They used empty boxes or pieces of metal to build shelters in open areas. People called these areas of little temporary houses  Hoovervilles.  They blamed President Hoover for their situation. So, too, did the men forced to sleep in public parks at night. They covered themselves with pieces of paper. And they called the paper  Hoover blankets.  People without money in their pants called their empty pockets  Hoover flags.  People blamed President Hoover because they thought he was not doing enough to help them. Hoover did take several actions to try to improve the economy. But he resisted proposals for the federal government to provide aid in a major way. And he refused to let the government spend more money than it earned. Hoover told the nation:  Economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive decision.  Many conservative Americans agreed with him. But not the 1,000,000s of Americans who were hungry and tired of looking for a job. They accused Hoover of not caring about common citizens. One congressman from Alabama said:  In the White House, we have a man more interested in the money of the rich than in the stomachs of the poor.  On and on the Great Depression continued. Of course, some Americans were lucky. They kept their jobs. And they had enough money to enjoy the lower prices of most goods. Many people shared their earnings with friends in need. Other Americans reacted to the crisis by leading protests against the economic policies of the Hoover administration. In 1932, a large group of former soldiers gathered in Washington to demand help. More than 8000 of them built the nation s largest Hooverville near the White House. Federal troops finally removed them by force and burned their shelters. Next week, we will look at how the Great Depression of the 1930s affected other countries. "
